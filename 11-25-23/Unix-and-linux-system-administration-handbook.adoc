*man* [section]  _title_

*section* (optional):: section number
*title*: usually a command, device, filename, or name of a library routine

*man* -k _keyword_

prints a list of man pages that have `keyword` in their on-lines synopses.

Man pages output from whatever your PAGER environment variable is set to.
Usually it's usually the program called *more* or the program called *less*.


== Storage of man pages
- *nrof* is the source code for man pages

- stored in directories under _/usr/share/man_ and compressed with *gzip* to
  save space. The `man` command knows how to decrompress them on the fly

`manpath`:: find the current default search path

use `which` or `whereis`, or `locate` to see if a program is installed. In linux
you'll need to install the *mlocate* package to use `locate`.

It is possible to find out which package a particular file belongs to:

.ubuntu
[source, sh]
----
dpkg-query -S /etc/apache2
----

canonical name:: trying to figure out the name of the pacakage form something
like the command name.

== Installing form source
usual install sequence

1. `./configure`
2. `make`
3. `sudo make install`

you'll often need to tweak the build configuration, so use `./configure --help`
to see the options available for each particular package. Another useful
`configure` option is `--prefix=_directory_`, which lets you compile the
software for installation somewhere other than `/usr/local`, which is used by
default.

== Installing from web script
Cross-platform software bundles increasingly offer an expedited installation
process that's driven by a shell script you download from the web with `curl`,
`fetch`, or `wget`.

.example
[source, sh]
----
curl -o /tmp/saltboot -sL https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sudo sh /tmp/saltboot
----

The bootstrap script investigates the local environment, then downloads,
installs and configures and appropriate version of the software. This type of
installation is particularly common in cases where the processs itself is
somewhat complex, but the vendor is highly motivated to make things easy for
users. (Another good example is RVM; see page 232)

this is not good

----
curl -L https://badvender.com | sudo sh
----

The root shell still runs even if `curl` outputs a partial script and then fails
-- say because of a transient network glitch
