== Describe Azure virtual private networks

=== VPN gateways
A VPn gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances
are deployed in dedication subnet of the virtual network and enable the
following connectivity:

- Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual netowrks through a sit-to-site
  connection

- Connect individual devices to other virtual networks through a
  network-to-network connection

All data transfer is encrypted inside a private tunnel as it crosses the
internet. You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However,
you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other
virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.

When setting up a VPN gateway, you must specify the type of VPN - either policy
based or route-based. The primary distinction between these two types is how
they determine which traffic needs encryption. In Azure, regardless of the VPN
type, the mothod of authentication employed is a pre-shard key.

- *Policy-based VPN gateways* specify statically the IP address of packets that
  should be encrypted through each tunnel. This type of device evaluates every
  data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that
  packet is going to be sent through.

NOTE: is this static ips? static ips do not change

- *In Route-based gateways*, IPSec tennels are modeled as a network interface or
  virtual tunnel interface. IP routing (either static routes or dynamic routing
  protocols) decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending
  each packet. Route-based VPNs are the preferred connection method for
  on-premeses devices. They're more resillient to topology changes such as the
  creation of new subnets.

use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of
connectivity:

- Connections between virtual networks
- Point-to-site connetions
- Multisite connections
- Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway


=== High-availability scenarios
If you're configuring a VPN to keep your information safe, you also want to be
sure that it's a highly available and fault tolerant VPN configuration. There
are a few ways to maximize the resiliency of your VPN gateway.

==== Active/standby

By default, VPN gateways are deplayed as two instances in an active/standby
configuration, even if you only see one VPN gateway resource in Azure. When
planned maintenance or unplanned distruption affects the active instance, the
standby instance automatically assumes responsibility for connections without
any user intervention. Connections are interupted during this failover, but
they're typically restored within a few seconds for planned maintenance within
90 seconds for unplanned disruptions.

==== Active/active
With the introduction of support for the BGP routing protocol, you can also
deply VPN gateways in an active/active configuration. In this configuration, you
assign a unique public IP address to each instance. You then create seperate
tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address. You can extend the high
availability by deploying an additional VPN device on-premises.

==== ExpressRoute failover

Another high-availability option is to configure a VPN gateway as a secure
failover path for ExpressRoute connections. ExpressRoute circuits have
resiliency built in. However, they aren't immune to physical problems that
affect the cables delivering connectivity or outages that affect the complete
ExpressRoute location. In high-availability scenarios, where there's risk
associated with an outage of an ExpressRoute circuit, you can also provision a
VPN gateway that uses that internet as an alternative method on connectivity. In
this way, you  can ensure there's always a connection to the virtual networks.

==== Zone-redundant gateways

In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute
gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration. This configuration
brings resiliency, scalability, and higher availability to virtual network
getways. Deploying gateways in Azure availability zones physically and logically
separates gateways within region while protecting your on-premises network
connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures. These gateways require different
gateway stock keeping units (SKUs) and use Standard public IP addresses instead
of Basic public IP address.


== Describing Azure ExpressRoute

- *ExpressRoute Circuit*: lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a
  private connection, with the help of a connectivity provider.

allows you to connnect offices, datacenter, or oter facilities to the Microsoft
cloud. Each location would have its own ExpressRoute circuit.

Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point
Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection though a connectivity provider at
a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connection don't go over the public
Internet. This allos ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster
speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over
the internet.

- *Colocatoin*: when organizations place their own serviers and other essential
  computing hardware for data storage in space rented in a physical data center
  owned and/or operated by a third party.

=== Features and benigits of ExpressRoute

There are several benifits of using ExpressRoute as the connection service
between Azure an on-premises networks.

- Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the
  geopolitical region.

- Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the
  ExpressRoute Global Reach.

- Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol
  (BGP)

- Built-in redendancy in every peering location for higher reliability

=== Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services

ExpressRoute enables direct access tot he following services in all regions:

- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Dynamics 365
- Azure compute services, such as Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure cloud services, such as Azuer Cosmos DB and Azure Storage

=== Global conectivity
you can enable ExpressRoute Global to exchange data across your on-premises
sites by connecting your ExpressRoute circuits.

=== Dynamic routing
ExpressROute uses the BGP. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises
networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing
between your on-premises network and services running in the microsoft cloud.

=== Built-in redundancy

Each connectivity provider uses redundant devices to ensure that connections
established with Microsoft are highly availabile. You can configure multiple
circuits to complement this feature.

=== ExpressROute connectivity models

ExpressRoute supports four modesl tha you can use to conect your on-premises
network to the Microsoft cloud:

- cloudExchange colocation
- Point-to-point Ethernet connection
- Any-to-any connection
- Directly from ExpressRoute sites

=== Co-location at a cloud exchange
Co-location refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being
physcially co-locatied at a cloud exchange, such as an ISP. If your facility is
co-located at a cloud exchange, you can request a virtual cross-connect to the
Microsoft cloud.

=== Point-toPoint Ethernet connection
Point-to-point ethernet connection refers to using a point-to-point connection
to connect your facility to the Microsoft cloud.

=== Any-to-any networks
With any-to-any connectivity, you can intergrate your wide are network (WAN)
with Azure by providing connections to your offices and datacenter. Azure
integrates with your WAN connection to provide a connection like you would have
between your datacenter and any branch offices.

=== Directly form ExpressRoute sites
You cannot directly connect into the Microsoft's global network at a peering
location strategically distributed across the wold. ExpressRoute Direct provides
dual 100 Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity. which supports Active/Active connectivity
at scale.

=== Security considerations
With ExpressRoute, your data doesn't travel of the public internet, so it's not
exposed to the potential risk associated with internet connumications.
ExpressRoute is a private connection from your on-premises infrastructure to
your Azure infrastructure. Even if you have an ExpressRoute connection, DNS
queries, certificate revocation list checking, and Azure Content Delivery
Network requests are still sent over the public internet.

== Describe Azure DNS
Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by
using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you  can
manage you DNS records using the same credentials, APIs tools, and biling as
your other Azure services.

=== Benifist of Azure DNS
- Reliability and performance
- Security
- Ease of Use
- Customizable virtual networks
- Alias records 

NOTE: Im guessing that alias networks might refer to something like an AAA record

=== Reliability and performance
- use anycast network, so each DNS query is answered by the closest available
  DNS server

- high availability

=== Security
Azure DNS is based on Azure Resource Manager, which provides features sush as

- Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who has access to
  specific actions for your organization.

- Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource
  or to find an error when troubleshooting

- Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource. Locking
  prevents other users in your organization form accidently deleting or
  modifying critical resources

=== Ease of use

- Procide DNS for your external resources as well

- Management in Azure portal

- Applications that require automated DNS managment can integrate with the
  service by using the REST API and SDKs.

=== Customizable virtual networks with private domains
Azure DNS also supports private DNS domains. This feature allows you to use
your own custom domain names in your private virtual networks, rather than
being stuck with the Azure-provided names.

=== Alias records
Azure DNS also supports alias record sets. You can use an alias record set to
refer to an Azure resource, such as an Azure public IP address, an Azure Traffic
Manager profile, or an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints. If the IP
address of the underlying resource changes, the alias record set seamlessly
updates itself during DNS resolution. The alis record set points to the service
instance, and the service instance is associated with an IP address.

IMPORTANT: you cannot use Azure DNS to buy a domain name

// Describe Azure storage services
== Describe Azure strorage accounts

offer:
- massively scalable object store for data objects
- disk storage for azure virtual machines
- file system service for the cloud
- messing store for reliable messaging
- noSQL store

- *Azure Blob Storage*: An object storage solution that you can use to store
  massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

blob storage is ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser,
stroing data for archives or distributes access, streaming video and audio, and
disaster recover scenarios.

azure file storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud. shares are
accessable using industrial standard network protocols.

mount azure file shares is just like connecting to shares on your local network.

azure disk storage provides disks for virtual machines and applications to
access and use as they need.

Azure offers both solid state drivers, and conventional hard drives

Azure table storage offers a no SQl data store for key value pairs, using large
scale sets.

You can use *azure table storage* to store petabytes of semistructured data and
keep your cost down.

*Azure que storage* provides a syncronous message queing for communication
between application components. Whether they are running in the cloud, on the
desktop, on premesis, or on moblie devices

there are thee *Azure storage tiers* that you can use to balance your cost, hot,
cool, and archive

=== Hot Storage tier
optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently, such as images for your
website

=== Cold Stroage tier
optimized for data that is infrequently accessed, and stored for at least thirty
days. Such as customer invoices.

=== Archive storage tier
Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed. strored for at least 180 days.
Such as long term backups.

==== Accounts
A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's
accesible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPs. Data in this account is
secure, highly availale, durable, amd massively scalable.

When you create your storage account, you'll start by picking the storage
account type. The type of account determines the storage services and redundancy
options and has an impact on the use cases. Below is a list of redundancy
options that will be covered later in this module.

- Locally redundant storage (LRS)
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
- Read-access geo-zone-redundant stroage (RA_GZRS)

  storage account that supports both Server Message Block (SMB) and NFS file
  shares.

//--------------------------

| Premium page blobs

| Page blobs only

| LRS

| Premium storage account type for page blobs only.
|===         

=== Storage account endpoints
One of the benefits of using an Azure Storage Account is having a unique
namespace in Azure for your data. In order to do this, every storage account in
Azure must have a unique-in-Azure account name. The combination of the account
name and the Azure Storage service endpoint forms the endpoints for your storage
account.

When naming your storage account, keep these rules in mind:

- Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may
  contain numbers and lowercase letters only

- Your storage acount name must be unique within Azure. No two storage accounts
  can have the same name. This supports the ability to have a unique, accessible
  namespace in Azure

The following table shows the endpoint format for Azure Storage services.

[%header, cols="1, 8"]

|Storage Service          | Endpoint

| Blob Storage            | https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net

== Descibe Azure storage redundancy
When deciding which redundancy option is best for your scenario, consider the
tradeoffs between lower cost and higher availability. The factors that help
determine which redundancy option you should choose include:

- How your data is replicated in teh primary region.

- Whether your data is replicated to a second region that is geographically
  distant to the primary region, to protect against regional distasters.

- Whether your application requires read access to the replicated data in the
  secondary region if the primary region becomes unavailable.

=== Redundancy in the primary region
Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary
region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the
primary region, locally redundant storage (LRS) and zone-redundant storage
(ZRS).

==== Locally Redundant storage
Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single
data center in the primary region. LRS provides at leat 11 nines of durability
(99.999999999%) of objects over a given year.

LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability
compared to other options. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive
failures. However, if a disaster such as a fire or flooding occurs within the
data center, all replicas of a storage account using LRS may be lost or
unrecoverable. To migrate this risk. Microsoft recommends using zone-redundant
storage (ZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), or geo-zone-redundant stroage(GZRS)

==== Zone redundant storage
For Availability Zone-enabled Regions, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates
your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in
the primary region. ZRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at
least 12 nines (99.9999999999%) over a given year.

With ZRS, your data is still accesible for both read and write operations even
if a zone becomes unavailable. No remouting of Azure file shares from the
connected clients is required. If a zone becomes unavailable, Azure undertakes
networking updates, such as DNS repointing. These updates may affect your
application if you access data before the updates have completed.

Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for scenarios that require
high availability. ZRS is also recommended for restricting replication of data
within a country or region to meet data governance requirements.

=== Redundancy in a secondary region
For applications requiring high durability, you can choose to additionally copy
the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundred of miles
away form the primary region.

When you create a storage account, you selet the primary region for the account.
The paired secondary region is based on Azure Region Pairs, and can't be
changed.

Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:
geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS). GRS is
similar to running LRS in two regions, and GZRS is similar to running ZRS in the
primary region and LRS in the secondary region.

By default, data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write
access unless there's a failover to the secondary region. If the primary region
becomes unavailable, you can choose to fail over the secondary region. After the
failover has completed, the secondary region becomes the primary region, and you
can again read and write data.

IMPORTANT: Because data is replicated to the secondary region asynchonously, a
           failure that affects the primary region may reslut in data loss if
           the primary region can't be recovered. The interval between the most
           recent writes to the primary region and the last write to the
           secondary region is known as the recovery point object (RPO). The RPO
           indicates the point in the time to which data can be recovered. Azure
           Storage typically has an RPO of less than 15 minutes, although
           there's currently no SLA on how long it takes to replicate data to
           the secondary region.

*asynchronous*:: not existing or happing at the same time

=== Geo-redundant storage
GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location
in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchonously to a
single physical location in the secondary region (the region pari) using LRS.
GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 16 nines
(99.99999999999999%) over a given year.

=== Geo-zone-redundant storgae

GZRS combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability
zones with protection from regional outages provided by geo-replication. Data in
a GZRS stroage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the
primary region (similar to ZRS) and is also replicated to a secondary geographic
region, using LRS, for protection from regional disasters. Microsoft recommends
using GZRS for applications requiring maximum consistency, durability, and
availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery.
GZRS is designed to provide at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) or durability
of objects over a given year.

=== Read access to data in the secondary region
Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your data to another
physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages.
However, the data is available to be read only if the customer on Microsoft
initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. However, if you
enable read access to the secondary region, your data is always available, even
when the primary region is running optimally. For read acccess to the secondary
region, enable read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access
geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).

IMPORTANT: Remember that the data in your secondary region may not be up-to-date
           due to RPO.
