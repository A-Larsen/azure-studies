![Responsibility Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-cloud-compute/media/shared-responsibility-b3829bfe.svg)

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The pyhsical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

## Define cloud models

Three cloud types: Private, public, and hybrid

### Private Cloud

- Used by a single entity 

My assumption is that they use the word "entity" because it might be controlled by
other means than by human interaction. Maybe bots are used?

- Greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment

- Greater control

- You decided where it is hosted

- No General public availablity

### Public cloud

- Third party

- Anyone that wants to puchase cloud services can access and use resources

- General public availablity

### Hybrid cloud

- Uses both public and private coulds in an inter-connected environment
