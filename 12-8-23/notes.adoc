== Azure Policy
works accross multiple subscriptions

Azure Policy helps to enfgore organizational standards to assess compliance
at-scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregrated view to
evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to
the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps bring your resources  to
compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic
remediation for new resources.

Specifically, some useful governance actions you can enfore with Azure Policy
include:

- Ensuring your team deploys Aazure resources only to allowed regions
- Enforcing the consistent application of taxonomic tags
- Requiring resources to sedn diagnostic logs to a Log Analytics workspace

Which Azure Arc, you can extend your policy-based governance across different
cloud providers and even to your local datacenters.

All Azure policy data and objects are *encrypted at rest*.

Azure Policy evaluates resources and actions in Azure by comparing the
properties of thos resources to business rules. These business rules, described
in JSON format, are known as policy definitions. To simplify management, several
business rules can be grouped together to form a policy initiative (sometimes
called a _policySet_). Once your business rules have been formed, the policy
definition or initiative is assigned to any scope of resources that Azure
supports, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource gruops, or
individual resources. The assignment applies to all resources within the
Resource Manager scope of that assignment. Subscopes can be executed, if
necessasry. 

Resources are evalutated at specific times during the resource lifecycle, the
policy assignment lifecycle, and for regular ongoing compliance evaluation. The
following are the times or events that cause a resource to be evaluated:

- A resource is created or updates in a scope with a policy assignment
- A policy or initiative is newly assigned to a scope.
- A policy or initiative already assigned to a scope is update.
- During the standard compliance evaluation cycle, which occurs every 24 hours

Business rules for handling non-compliant resources vary widely between
organizations. Examples of how an organization wants the platform to respond to
a non-compliant resource include:

- Deny the resource change
- Log the change to the resource
- Alter the resource before the change
- Alter teh resource after the change
- Deploy related compliant resources
- Block actions on resources

While these effects primaryly affect a resource when the resource is created or
updated. Azure Policy also supports dealing with existing non-compiant resource
without needing to alter that resource. 

Resources go through ARM THEN go to the policy layer.

== Encryption at Rest
Encryption is the secure encoding of data used to protect confidentiality of
data. The Encryption at Rest design in Azure use symmetric encryption to encrypt
and decrypt large amounts of data quickly accourding to a simple conceptual
model:

- A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt data as it is written to storage

- The same encryption key is used to decrypt that data as it is readed for use
  in memory

- Data may be partitioned, and different keys may be used for each partition

keys must be stored in a secure location with identity-based access control and
audit policies. Data encryptio keys whcih are stored outside of secure locations
are encrypted with a key encryption key kept in a secure location.

Encryption at rest procides data protection for stored data (at rest). Attacks
against data at-rest include attempts to obtain physical access to the hardware
on whcih the data is stored, and then compromise the contained data.

Encryption at rest is designed to prevent the attacker from accesing the
unencrypted data by ensuring the data is encrypted when on disk. If an attacker
obtains a hard drive with encrypted data bt not the encryption keys, the
attacker must defeat the encryption to read teh data.

Azure Policy helps organizations to enforce organizational standards and to
assess compliance at-scale.

To evaluate whether your company's Azure environment meets regulatory
requirements you can use the trust portal, Micrsoft Cloud defender, or azure
security center.

- *Microsft Defender for endpoint*, is an enterprise endpoiint security platform -
  it incorporates things like next generation antivirus, but also includes
  behavioral sensors, leverages cloud based security analytics and thread
  intelligence in order to provide security for windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS.

- *Micrsoft defender for Cloud*, provides "cloud security Posture Management"
  (CSPM), providing a security analysis of all the resources in your cloud
  estates, and Cloud Wordload Protection (CWP) which gives specific protectoion
  for your resources such as VMs, cloud storage, databases, security keys,
  containers, etc.

Azure key value CAN NOT analyze security log files from Azure Virtual machines

Azure Key Vaut is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets.

An Azure security principal is a security identity that user-created apps,
services, and automation tools use to access specific Azure resources. A
security principal should only need to do specific things, unlike a general user
identity.

Azure key value can store app secrets.

Azure key vault is used to store secrets for SERVER APPLICATIONS.

Azure key vault enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to protect dat
when it's traveling between Azure key vault and clients.

Azure key Vault automatically generated a new secret after every use.

You can use Azure key value to store certificates.

If you are not using virual machines and all its resources you should shutdown
the virtual machine
== Virtual Machines

=== Shuting down a virtual machine VS. Stoping a virtual machine
When you just stop a virtual machine (or keep it in a deallocated state), you
will not be charged for the virtual machine compute resources, but you will
still need to pay for the operating system and the data storage disk attached.

== Other
Q::
you have an Azure environment that contains multiple Azure virtual machines.
You plan to implement a solution that enables the client computers on your
on-premises network to communticate to the Azure virtual machines. You need to
recommend which Azure Resources must be created for the planned solution. Which
two Azure resources should you include in the recommendation.

A:: 
A virtual network gateway, and a gateway subnet.

breakdown:: 
Notice how it says CLIENT COMPUTERS. Because it is needing to be accessed on
client computers you will need a gateway to connect. You also use virtual
networks along with subnets to connect to virtual machines.

PaaS is about a platform where a developer can design and deploy an application.

Azure Files is an example of PaaS, it is bulit on top of Azure storage. It
provides fully managed file shares over a protocol called SMB (Server Message
Block).

Cloud Comuting leverages https://youtu.be/FZR0rG3HKIk?si=7utIjLzzIxDm1YGM[virtualization] to provide

== Virtualization

virtualization:: Is the process of creating a software based or virtaul version
                 of something (like compute, storage, networking, servers or
                 applications).

The Hypervisor makes virtualization feasible.

Hypervisor:: A piece of software that runs above the physical server or host.

there is a type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.

=== Type 1 hypervisor (AKA Bare Metal Hypervisors)
A hypervisor that is install directly ontop of the physical server.


Most frequently used.
low latency

ex.  Microsft Hyper V

== Type 2 hypervisor (AKA Hosted)
Their is a layer of host OS that sits between the host and the hypervisor.

Not as fequent.

higher latency.


=== VMs
You can install VMs once you have a virtual machine installed. you can run
multiple virtual machines on a hypervisor. You can move a virtaul machine from
one hypervisor to another hypervisor almost instantaneously.
