Azure provides and identity management system based on their popular "Active
directory".

some protocols for authentication:
- SAML
- OpenID
- WS Federation

Just-in-time (JIT)
Just-enough-access (JEA)

Their is scalable and elastic expenditure models

operational expenditure model for migrating virtual machines

capital expenditure:: Spending of money on physical infrastructure upfront and
                      then deducting that expense from you tax bill over time.

Operating expenditure:: Spending money on services or products now and being
                        billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from
                        your tax bill in the same year

capital expedniture is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time
and usually has no recurring cost.

operating expenditure has no upfront cost but has a recurring cost.

Capital expenditure are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be
used over the long term

Azure Reserved VM instances is an example of capital expenditure

capital expenditure
- server cost
- network cost
- backup and archive cost
- business continuity
- disaster recovery

Buisiness continuity:: a business's level of readiness to maintain critical
functions after an emergency or disruption.

agility:: Cloud agility is the ability to quickly develop, test and launch
          applications in a cloud-based environment

fault tolerence:: The ability of a system to continue to function in the event
of a failure of some of its components

hight availabily:: to keep services up and running for long periods of time,
                   with little downtime, depending on the service in question


In Paas you don't have to worry about the underling infastructure. You do nno
install applications, or manage them.

If you have specialized hardware requirements you should always go for private
cloud

You should ONLY run script form Azure cloud shell in the Azure portal, or
through Azure Power shell module.

Powershell 7.0.6, Powershell 7.13, or higher is the recommended versoin of
Powershell for use  with te Azure AZ PowerShell module

elasticity allows to quickly expand or decresses storage and computing
resources.

I you need to control the ports that devices on the internet can use to access
virtual machines, you should create a network security gruop.

You can use Azure network security gruop to filter network traffic between Azure
resource in a Azure virtual network. A network security gruop contains security
rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic
from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source,
and destination, port and protocol. Low number prorities will go first. Any
rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have teh same
attributes as rules with higher priorities aren't processed. source and
destination is ip addresses. You can't specify multiple IP addresses and IP
address ranges in network security group created through the classic deployment
model.

NSG:: You can use and Azure network security group to filter network traffic
between Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.

Azure AD:: Azure Active Directory, is a cloud-based identity and access
management service. This service helps your employees access external resources,
such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousand of other SaaS
applications.

Azure Network gateway:: Azure VPN Gateway connects your on-premises networks
to Azure through Site-to-Site VPNs in a similar way that you set up and connect
to a remote office.

Azure Key Vault:: Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure
store for secrets. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and
other secrests.

Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load balancing solution

public cloud does NOT have limited storage. It IS self-service management
