# Summary
Learned more about the fundamentals of Azure and read more of the Uix and system
adminstation book. 

# Take-away
Azure seems to be a useful thing that many people are turning to (along with
AWS). The world seems to be heading toward cloud computing so I should probably
jump on the train as well and catch up. Luckly I seem to have some important
knowledge outside of cloud computing that could be benificial.

# Future learning
I know C very well, which is good. But Getting better with python might be a
better choice for this type of word, since everyone is using it. Luckly I have
some experience with python and can program pretty well in it but don't quite
know all the quirkey ins and outs. What other things are people looking for that
I may need to work on?
